This folder contains only the prediction part of PyMACER built for plugging it in a vscode extension. For more details see [Microsoft ai.ed](https://github.com/microsoft/ai.ed) repo.

## Steps to Run:

Create a virtual environment for Python. Here, we'll assume this environment will be located `C:\venv\pymacer`.

```
python -m venv C:\venv\pymacer
C:\venv\pymacer\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The pipeline is tested with python 3.8
